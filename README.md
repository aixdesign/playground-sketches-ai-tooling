# AI Tooling: playground-sketches-to-images

Experiment on creating an image segmentation model to make playground sketches

Read the full log of my experiment [here](https://www.notion.so/nadiapiet/Experiment-2-Image-Segmentation-Playgrounds-from-sketches-Image-Segmentation-0c313cb9f4a34dbe84af57ac557ccf00). Very detailed description and log, including images and videos, of what I got up to.

If you prefer to watch over reading, I have [Part 1](https://www.instagram.com/p/CjA_zyqgdXB/) and [Part 2](https://www.instagram.com/p/CjDSVlYA7AR/) of my experiment process.

This is my version of code. Almost all I didn't write myself, so here's the references:

** Original [SPADE-COCO](https://github.com/agermanidis/SPADE-COCO) Github repo by agermanidis **

For dataset preparation I used:
- [COCO-Annotator](https://github.com/jsbroks/coco-annotator) is from jsbrooks. Docker was too difficult to set up so I abandoned this repo and went to...

- [labelme](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme) is from wkentaro. 


For starting my synthetic dataset:

- playground_dataset folder has the blender files and scripts that I took from this tutorial by [Immersive Limit 'Synthetic Datasets With Blender'](https://www.immersivelimit.com/tutorials/synthetic-datasets-with-blender).
